- Greetings, i'm Seelie!
- I enjoy general gaming, drawing, and conversing about random topics nobody asked about
- I often go on random four-hour rants about the exact sciences behind fictional magic powers
- Not learning anything atm, don't even really know how to use this website
- Self-Esteem at as all time low :D
- No shared contacts atm
